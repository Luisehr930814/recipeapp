"""
Commandâ€‘line tool for suggesting recipes and planning meals.

This script forms the core of the RecipeApp project. It prompts the user for
available ingredients, recommends recipes from a small internal database,
generates shopping lists and helps to plan meals for the week.

It is designed to run in a terminal and uses only the Python standard
library. For more details, see the README.md file in the repository.
